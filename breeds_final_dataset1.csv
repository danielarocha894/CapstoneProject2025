Yorkshire Terrier;Small;Up to 30 minutes per day;Flat/ Apartment;Every day;Long;No;Over 12 years;Yes;Either;Small/ medium garden;TOY;The Toy breeds are small companion or lap dogs. Many of the Toy breeds were bred for this capacity although some have been placed into this category simply due to their size. They should have friendly personalities and love attention. They do not need a large amount of exercise and some can be finicky eaters.;Yorkshire Terriers are small but spirited dogs   though they are prone to several health conditions that require attentive care. Tracheal collapse is relatively common in the breed and can cause chronic coughing or breathing difficulties   especially during excitement or exercise. Luxating patellas   where the kneecap slips out of place   may also affect their mobility and comfort. Another serious concern is portosystemic shunt   a liver condition that can interfere with toxin removal from the bloodstream and often requires medical or surgical management. Additionally   some Yorkshire Terriers are at risk of developing diabetes   which needs to be carefully controlled through diet and insulin therapy.
