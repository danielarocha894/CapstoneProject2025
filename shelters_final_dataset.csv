Maya,Staffordshire-Terrier-Mix,"6 years",Female,"Maya had already found a dream home in Lower Saxony, but unfortunately, contrary to expectations, it turned out that she can't stand cats. We had, of course, tried it out here at the animal shelter beforehand, and her reaction didn't allow for any negative conclusions. However, animals can behave quite differently in a private household than in a shelter, especially when they begin to feel at home and become more confident. Now our Maya is back at the shelter and is starting a new attempt to find a home without furry roommates or other animals in general.
Maya originally came to us after being confiscated for violating the Animal Welfare Act. She is a very lively and people-oriented dog who wants plenty of exercise. She especially enjoys playing foraging games. She knows basic commands and is house-trained. She lets other dogs walk her around calmly, but she doesn't want any more contact with other dogs. In her youthful exuberance, her temper sometimes gets a bit out of hand—she doesn't mean any harm, but occasionally unintentionally becomes a bit rowdy. Therefore, it's very important that the person at the other end of the leash is a) steady and b) when in doubt, ""friendly and assertive."" Maya is sometimes a bit clumsy and doesn't show enough consideration for people.
We would like this charming bundle of energy to find a home with active people who have plenty of time for her. Any children should be at least 14 years old; she is absolutely not suitable for smaller/younger children. Please note that, depending on the breed, a landlord's permit is usually required, and depending on the state, muzzles and leashes may automatically be required in public. Maya is currently unable to climb stairs due to cruciate ligament problems, so a ground-level home would be ideal.
Would you like to give Maya a lovely home or do you have any questions? Please contact her animal caretakers at Benji House by phone at +49 30 76 888-212 or fill out the form below. We look forward to hearing from you!",https://getbalu.com/pets/dog,Tierheim Berlin
Bonny,Australian Shepard,"7 years",Female,"The beautiful Bonny was given to us by her previous owners for personal reasons. Now this very sweet and lively dog is looking for a new home.
Bonny will only be rehomed in a rural home with a garden. Children living in the household should be at least 14 years old.","Feldstraße 8, 21493 Schwarzenbek, Germany",Tierheim Schwarzenbek
Rubble,Mischling,"1 year",Male,"Rubble is currently in a foster home.
Rubble originally came to us at Sonnenhof with his mother, Pauline, and his five siblings at the age of about three weeks. Since then, he's been through quite a bit: After a short stay in a new home and with a foster family, Rubble severely injured his leg and had to undergo multiple surgeries.
In new situations and around strangers, Rubble is initially insecure and often reacts by barking. He needs time to gain trust and likes to decide for himself when to allow closeness. However, once he has established a bond, he is cuddly, eager to learn, and full of joy for life.
For Rubble, we are looking for people with heart and mind who are willing to accompany him on his special journey, provide him with the necessary care, and accept him as he is. Attending dog training would be very helpful for his further development and is encouraged by us.","Hochkreit 8, 82401 Rottenbuch, Deutschland","Sonnenhof für Mensch und Tier, eine Einrichtung vom Deutschen Tierschutzbund e.V."
Bingo,Mischling,"14 years",Male,"Seit 2023 wartet Bingo bereits im Tierheim auf ein neues Zuhause. Eine viel zu lange Zeit, denn besonders in Bingos Alter ist jeder Moment kostbar und jeder weitere Tag im Tierheim ein Tag zu viel. Hier wird der liebenswerte Mischlingsrüde natürlich von Pflegern und Gassigehern auf Händen getragen und wir versuchen ihm die Wartezeit möglichst schön zu gestalten – Sozialkontakte mit weiteren Artgenossen und uns Zweibeinern, sowie ausgiebige Spaziergänge und Leckereien… und trotzdem kann selbst die beste Pflege und Fürsorge hier kein eigenes Zuhause ersetzen.
Weshalb der hübsche Kerl noch bei uns ist, bleibt jedoch ein Rätsel. Einige Adoptanten sind auf der Suche nach einem bereits älteren, gesetzten Hund für kurze Gassirunden, doch ist Bingo hier für meisten „noch zu fit“. Natürlich sieht und merkt man ihm sein Alter inzwischen auch an. Er hat bereits ein paar graue Haare, das ein oder andere Lipom und auch der Blick wird zunehmend trüb – doch genießt Bingo seine Spaziergänge noch immer in vollen Zügen. Getreu dem Motto „Wer Rastet der Rostet“ sind auch seine ehrenamtlichen Gassigeher fleißig dabei, den Herrn in Bewegung zu Halten. Selbst noch ein Stündchen am Stück und einen zügigen Schritt kann der Spanier noch getrost mithalten. Mit genügend Sport und Muskelaufbau bleiben wir optimistisch, dass ihn diese Fitness noch einige Zeit begleiten wird.
Andere Familien wünschen sich wiederum einen lernwilligen Jungspund, den man „leichter“ erziehen kann als einen älteren Hund. Natürlich kann Bingo trotz seiner aufgeweckten, aktiven Art keinen Teenager ersetzen, doch lernen und beschäftigt werden kann er noch immer. Der große Agilitystar schlummert nicht mehr in ihm, doch ist dies auch bei den meisten jüngeren, Durchnittshaushunden eher selten der Fall. Für kleineres Gehirnjogging, wie Leckerliesuchen oder einfache Spielereien ist Bingo, besonders im Blick auf die leckere Belohnung, stehts zu haben. Auch kleinere Tricks kann er auch mit 13 Jahren noch lernen.
Nun suchen wir nocheinmal ganz deutlich nach einem passenden Deckel für Bingo. Natürlich hat auch er Eigenheiten, Ecken und Kanten – wie jedes atmende Wesen. Auch er kann mal an der Leinen andere Hunde anpflaumen, doch geht es meistens ohne TamTam. Auch er kann im Laufe des Lebens noch gesundheitliche Probleme entwickeln, doch ist er aktuell noch fit. Alles in Allem ein ganz normaler Hund – nur leider mit etwas mehr Zeitdruck auf der Suche nach einem neuen Zuhause, als manch jüngerer Vierbeiner.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg
Maurice,Dackel-Terrier-Mix,"9 years",Male,"Our Maurice has been found. He is a funny but also very self-confident dog and is looking for a home with experience with dogs, or ideally terriers.
Maurice is people-oriented, house-trained, and calmly leads past other dogs. He knows basic commands and enjoys food-search games. Whether he can be left alone for a while needs to be tested and, if necessary, practiced patiently.
Maurice is a bit moody—he might be happy about something one moment, but growl the next. People who provide him with security but also consistency are important to him. We suspect he could also move in with an existing first female dog—this would have to be tested. Younger children should not live in the household.
Please note that several visits will be necessary to get to know Maurice.","Hausvaterweg 39, 13057 Berlin, Germany",Tierheim Berlin
Gulliver,Mischling,"4 years",Male,"Gulliver found his way to us after life in his previous home wasn't as harmonious as we had imagined when he was adopted many years ago. Initially, minor issues, which many dog owners are confronted with over time, quickly escalated, and what started as a minor issue developed into a highly reactive elephant that put the continued cohabitation to the test.
Many behaviors become ingrained over time, both in the dog and its owners. Negative experiences create tension and fear, which reinforces pessimistic expectations that make it difficult to stay motivated and optimistic during training. Now the black male is getting a complete ""reset,"" and together we are embarking on his journey into a carefree future.
The animal shelter had previously shown little of the insecure, yet explosive nature of this exciting mixed-breed dog. The bright male quickly settled in and got used to his caregivers. With our relaxed, yet firm demeanor, we were able to quickly convince Gulliver of our leadership qualities. This sensitive fellow once again demonstrated his keen sense for the emotions of his two-legged friends. Whether tense or relaxed, Gulliver reads his companion like a book and clearly reflects their emotional state. On walks, you can see that good preparatory work has already been done with him. If he is led consistently, he walks relaxed beside you on a loose leash and voluntarily orients himself towards his owner – a good foundation for further training.
We are currently regularly practicing dog encounters, but even there he is making rapid progress and scores points with his responsiveness in stressful situations. If you give him too much leeway outside, he likes to go along with whatever he wants. Be it pedestrians who he fixates on from a distance and barks at, or strange dogs who he also barks at. That's why it's important to have the right standing and to recognize and manage critical situations early on.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg
Kronos,Rhodesian Ridgeback,"1 year",Male,"Ridgeback Rüde Kronos, oder liebevoll auch nur „der Papa“ genannt, kam zusammen mit einer ebenfalls unkastrierten Hündin und deren 10 Söhne und Töchtern zu uns. Zu seiner Vergangenheit gibt es leider sonst nicht all zu viele Infos, nur sein Chip hat uns sein Herkunftsland, die Niederlande, verraten. Der Rest bleibt zum größten Teil Spekulation basierend auf seinem anfänglichen Charakter und der Auffindesituation.




Ein Halsband zu tragen, an einer Leine zu laufen oder sich auch einfach nur anfassen zu lassen war anfangs bereits eine große Herausforderung. Auch das Durchatmen und mal chillen fällt ihm noch schwer und wird sicherlich künftig noch einiges an Zeit und Arbeit kosten – es bleibt jedoch unabdingbar, um ihm die Teilnahme an einem entspannten Alltag ermöglichen zu können.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg

Prada,Mischling,"5 years",Female,"After moving from a Romanian animal shelter, little Prada found a new home in Germany. Over time, the initially insecure, calm dog thawed out and gradually took over the reins in her new world. Unfortunately, she lacked experience in dealing with her exaggerated self-awareness, and so, without guidance from her humans, Prada increasingly lost herself in the inappropriate role of boss of the house. Her staff were reprimanded and reprimanded accordingly, which ended with the occasional biting incident in her last home.

Hannah,Husky,"5 years",Female,"Husky dog Hannah does her breed proud. She loves going for walks, preferably for long ones. She walks perfectly on a leash – unless you stand still for too long, which she, as a Husky, finds completely unnecessary.
Hannah is people-oriented, doesn't shy away from anything, and loves to learn. She also loves children, so she could easily become a family dog.
Hannah already knows some basic commands, can ride in the car without any problems, and has already experienced a domestic environment.
Hannah gets along well with other dogs.","Eichholz, 70794 Filderstadt, Germany",Tierschutzverein Tierfreunde Filderstadt e.V.
Bumi,Kangal Mix,"8 years",Male,"Our big, fluffy Kangal, Bumi, has had some ups and downs in his life. Born in an animal shelter and unfortunately raised in a deprived youth, his start was extremely difficult. Fortunately, after being placed with his new family, he was able to catch up on a lot, which has allowed him to develop into a wonderful, albeit cautious, companion.


On the leash, he knows full well that other two- and four-legged creatures are of no interest and is not easily unsettled. Even walks with other shelter residents are no problem for this big man - it is only when they live directly together on the shelter grounds that his stoic livestock guardian becomes apparent again. Bumi can happily do without other dogs in the rest of his everyday life and prefers to spend time on his own rather than sharing the attention of his caregivers, basket, or food. In the past, Bumi has shown that he would particularly defend food and chews from other dogs or children, which is why we would rather see him in a quiet household without other dogs and children.
Bumi longs for a new home where he can settle in and blossom again. Regular exercise would help not only his soul but also his body to stay healthy. Unfortunately, Bumi was diagnosed with hip dysplasia – a deformity of the hip that unfortunately affects many dogs these days. The deformation of the hip joint cannot be reversed, but with the help of targeted exercise, muscle building, and physiotherapy, dogs can be supported so that they can walk pain-free for as long as possible and the problems do not worsen. Since Bumi loves to splash around, especially in warm weather, a swim or two would be a good idea in addition to walks to give him some exercise.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg
Kiez,Labrador Mix,"3 years",Female,"Young Kiez has experienced quite a bit of turmoil and instability in the past. Even as a puppy, Kiez's life started turbulently, because while most puppies go to their new families alone, she embarked on a big journey with a sibling. For the two of them, it was constant partying. They could run wild with their playful antics, and training or learning to be calm steadily took a backseat. Spurred on by her peer, Kiez lived only for forwards – higher, faster, further – until all the commotion at home became too much for everyone when the two-legged members of her family's circumstances changed.
Well-intentioned, but unfortunately very impulsive and lacking in planning, Kiez was sent to live with acquaintances to spare her a stop at the animal shelter. Within a day, the offer of help turned into her own cry for help, because the bundle of energy, for whom stability and boundaries had always been foreign concepts, quickly became overwhelmed in her new environment. Since she was only ever known for her cheerful, playful nature, she was thrown straight into the thick of things, skipping over the crucial settling-in period. This ultimately led to Kiez completely losing it. Within a single day, everyone had the opportunity to interact with Kiez's teeth if she didn't know how to gracefully extricate herself from an exciting situation. And her motto remained ""only forward,"" meaning there was no going back to her first home. With a dog who was now not only hyperactive but had even bitten someone, suddenly no one wanted to take responsibility anymore, and so she inevitably ended up at our animal shelter. Here, Kiez can finally take a deep breath so we can address the root of the problems, because Kiez is by no means a dangerous or malicious dog. This motivated Labrador retriever gets excited easily and would do almost anything for a treat. Seemingly well-behaved, but behind the funny facade lies not true training, but rather a kind of dressage. Sit, stay, go on the blanket, or walk backward – none of that is a problem. Simply doing nothing, relaxing, calming down, or not being the center of attention is much more appealing. It's easy to be tempted to push her further, because the pretty little thing is undeniably cute. Kiez has a lot to process and is learning to accept boundaries for the first time; it's all very stressful, and for such energetic dogs, it's a far better form of exercise than any obstacle course. Currently, we often have to manage her in everyday life until Kiez is ready in training to do it independently. The training process is certainly frustrating for both human and dog, but it's essential for a relaxed future for everyone. Gradually, the penny drops, and Kiez is able to remain increasingly calm even in tense situations. It's certainly still a long way to the relaxed ""picture-perfect Labrador,"" but we are confident that with appropriate guidance, we can steer the young lady toward becoming a suitable everyday companion. You reap what you sow, and so the focus will now be on planting the delicate seeds of frustration tolerance and impulse control.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg
Nokart,Französische Bulldogge,"8 years",Male,"Nokart has been found. He is a personable, lively, and very self-confident fellow. He knows basic commands and is house-trained. When out for walks, he calmly lets himself be led past other dogs.
At our veterinary practice, he will receive free lifelong treatment for his musculoskeletal system because he has problems walking. He also has a condition called megaesophagus (enlargement of the esophagus), which prevents food from being transported properly to the stomach. Therefore, he must be fed while standing almost vertically, otherwise he will vomit his food. We have found a good solution for this and are happy to advise you. He will receive free lifelong treatment for this and his arthritis at our veterinary practice.
Nokart does not cope well with frustration. As a result, he quickly becomes angry and tries to snap or bite the leash. He is looking for people with experience with this breed. Although he can live in the city, he needs a very quiet, single-story home without children. He can no longer climb stairs. Whether he is suitable as a second dog needs to be tested.
If you would like to meet Nokart or have any questions about him, please contact his animal caretakers at +49 30 76888-220 or fill out the form below.

Moxy,Australian Shepherd,"9 years",Female,"The pretty Australian Shepherd Moxy found her way to us via another animal welfare organization. At first, she was rather reserved and shy around us keepers. She had to settle in and get used to her new surroundings.
Winning Moxy over is quite a lot of work. Her ice is very thick, and it takes a lot of patience and nerve to melt it. Until then, Moxy is skeptical of her counterpart and sets clear rules. These, of course, tend to be in her favor and are enforced, if necessary with the help of her 42 augments. But she's worth it! Every milestone, sometimes hard work, reveals a new, endearing facet of this pretty Aussie lady. Once she's gained trust in her humans, she's open and enthusiastic, loves to be cuddled and have fun together.


Overall, with Moxy, it's important to always stay on track - even if she's just letting go. All this effort will surely cost her a few gray hairs, but it's worth it. Moxy is excited about her new phase of life and will bring this joy into her two-legged friends' everyday lives.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg
Woody,Mischling,"4 years",Male,"Woody came to us when his life path was leading him in the wrong direction. If the necessary upbringing is neglected at a young age, it can take its toll later in life - as was the case with this charming Romanian. He knows how to use his big eyes to his advantage and he also finds a way to get his way. If an endearing look and witty antics aren't enough to avoid possible consequences, he uses his entire repertoire of threatening gestures and also knows how to deploy his 42 sparkling white arguments.
In general, Woody sees himself more in the position of referee than in the role of player. Just because he doesn't want to follow the rules himself doesn't mean that his humans don't have to. He hands out yellow and red cards as he sees fit. To underline this position, he has claimed all kinds of resources for himself in the past. From his own food to his owner's food and bed. Woody deliberately seeks out such conflicts in order to test his boundaries again or to redefine them.
Of course, this high-flying lifestyle cannot continue – the little king is fully aware of this – which is why a lot of training is now on the agenda. Such a difficult and responsible task doesn't really suit him. The young male has bright, relaxed, and eager-to-learn sides, but he can only fully develop these sides once the burden of having to control everything at all times is lifted from his shoulders. To achieve this, he is now undergoing the unpopular and labor-intensive training.
The little man is searching for his place in society. And for a human partner who will accept the odd gray hair until he achieves success. Throughout his life, Woody has succeeded in making progress with sustainability and stubbornness. It'll take a while to rewrite this success story. Two steps forward, one step back – and yet progress has already been made. Now all that's missing is the right home, where we're ready to continue the training and show Woody how relaxed and fun the world can be when he lets himself get involved.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg
Mads,Staffordshire-Bulldog-Mix,"7 years",Male,"Hello, I'm Mads. I always try very hard to please my owners. Unfortunately, new situations scare me a lot, and I need a lot of encouragement. I'm very people-oriented anyway, especially if I know them well. Then I love to be cuddled – I can sometimes get a little boisterous out of sheer joy. I'm a bit skeptical of men for a long time. I take women much more quickly.
I ended up in the animal shelter because something really stupid happened. When I get food in my bowl, I don't recognize anything anymore. I guess that's called ""resource guarding."" And then I bit the other dog. When my previous owner tried to intervene, I unfortunately caught her too. If my bowl is empty, I don't have any problems at all. I also accept treats without any problems, and I'd gladly give them lots and lots again and again!
It would probably be good if my new owners knew about dogs – including my breed. And a good feeding plan would help ensure that something bad like this never happens again. That's why I'm better off being kept alone, even though I actually really love dogs. There shouldn't be any children in my home either. Better safe than sorry. The city could definitely be something for me. Since I'm one of the so-called ""listed dogs,"" you definitely need a landlord's permit.
Phew—that's a lot of everything. Is there anyone who'd still like to get to know me? That would be great! The best way to find out is to call my animal caretakers","Hausvaterweg 39, 13057 Berlin, Germany",Tierheim Berlin
Ada,Kangal,"6 years",Female,"Ada ist eine wundervolle, ausgeglichene Persönlichkeit und auch optisch ein echter Blickfang. Mit einer Schulterhöhe von ca. 75 cm und einem dennoch schlanken und grazilen Körperbau beweist Ada, wie elegant ein Herdenschützer sein kann.
Die „Arbeitsweise“ hingegen wirft ein ganz anderes Licht auf die sonst so zarte Riesin. Typisch Kangal hat sie immer ein Auge auf alles, was vor ihrem Gehege oder der anderen Seite des Gartenzauns los ist. Wenn nötig, werden ungebetene Beobachter durch tiefes Bellen und ordentlich Radau aus ihrem Zuständigkeitsbereich verwiesen. Auch andere Hunde dürfen sich was anhören, wenn Ada in Pöbel-Laune ist.

Woody,Riesenschnauzer-Mix,"13 years",Male,"Our Woody came to the animal shelter because he is very jealous of food, and unfortunately, this bad habit led to a bite incident in his previous home. He is looking for people with experience with dogs who can address his behavior and with whom he can be his only prince.
Woody knows the common basic commands, rides on the bus/train, and can even be left alone for a few hours. He has lived with cats before—but outside, he tends to chase them, as well as other small animals and game. He is often suspicious, especially of strange men. He also dislikes loud, hectic children.

Nanuk,Staffordshire-Terrier-Mix,"11 years",Male,"Please note: Nanuk is only suitable for a shelter-like environment. His new home must offer the opportunity to handle him with safety training (we trained him to wear a muzzle and leash without contact). A fence system is therefore necessary where Nanuk can be kept in contact with people, but still shielded from direct confrontation. A kennel (with a heated indoor enclosure) and, ideally, a dog room with outdoor access are ideal for this.
Nanuk came to the shelter after being confiscated. Lack of distance, petting, and being touched in general are not his thing—he likes it when everyone stays in his ""dance zone."" If you respect that, he will gain trust and be able to relax better. He loves being outside with his owner, sniffing the world around him.
Nanuk defends his food, is not a beginner's dog, and prefers owners with experience with the breed who can provide him with clear leadership and spend plenty of time together on outings. He is not suitable for a family with children. Please note that, due to his breed, he is subject to muzzle and leash requirements in Berlin, and a landlord's permit is required for his ownership. He will receive free lifelong treatment for spondylosis at our veterinary practice.

Arion,Arion,"7 years",Male,"Arion is representative of many rescues gone wrong of small ""surprise packages"" in the form of young dogs or ""puppies"" (as they are so often falsely advertised) from Eastern Europe.


But what kind of dog arrived here back then? A large, proud herd protector, aware of his (original) task and, due to a lack of leadership, confidently carrying it out? No, absolutely not. Arion was completely in limbo. If he had learned one thing in his few years, it was that he couldn't rely on anyone, and that no one could give him stability or security. So, although he wasn't able to look after his system himself, he still felt compelled to take on this task.
Today, Arion lets go of the reins with the right people and behaves admirably. Relaxed cuddles or going for a walk are perfectly possible. Dogs and passersby are ignored, the leash is slack, and the dog trots relaxedly next to, behind, or sometimes in front of the owner, depending on the command. Of course, he is not an enthusiastic herding dog, but the herd protector still wants to please. Arion knows who he can rely on, but he also knows who he cannot rely on, who doesn't have the right charisma. Here, he quickly falls back into old patterns. Dogs and passersby are attacked, and it quickly becomes dangerous for the person at the other end of the leash.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg

When Buddy gets stressed, he tends to bark. In his previous home, this led to Buddy barking in many situations outside, especially when he encountered other dogs. Even leaving him alone at home wasn't possible, as Buddy would protest loudly.
At our animal shelter, the picture is somewhat different. Of course, there are situations in which Buddy barks, but overall, Buddy is very easy to lead by his caregivers. He has completely stopped barking when meeting other dogs and is otherwise very well-oriented and cooperative. He enjoys long walks and is a very active dog who needs plenty of exercise but also wants to be mentally challenged.","Eichholz, 70794 Filderstadt, Germany",Tierschutzverein Tierfreunde Filderstadt e.V.

Charlie,Mischling,"5 years",Male,"Charlie has a very chaotic and insecure past. Fleeing and escaping from frightening situations hasn't always brought him the desired results in his life so far. When initial threats and growling didn't help him, the first biting incident occurred in a confining situation. It wasn't until he got to the animal shelter that he was able to build trust in himself and his two-legged friends, which helps him keep a cool head in many situations.
Diligent training, time, patience, and exposure to many different environmental influences have turned Charlie into a completely new dog. The shadows of his past have increasingly faded, and his insecure self only rarely comes to the fore.
The little Romanian has now become a perfectly plausible everyday companion dog, provided he receives appropriate guidance. Because Charlie now knows his worth and is willing to voice his opinion (even without being asked). If he's given too much freedom on the leash, he'll bark at strange dogs or passersby. If someone nevertheless ventures too close to him, he might respond with his 42 ""arguments."" Unannounced visitors have also experienced this bad mood in the past, which is why such situations still require some management. However, once Charlie has understood his place and that he won't be disturbed by strangers there, he can easily accept these spatial restrictions and withdraw.
From the very beginning, Charlie spent his time at the shelter with other dogs. Initially, the focus was on coaxing the shy guy out of his shell a little with more relaxed companions. In the meantime, however, he's become a solid, socially competent cornerstone for many dog groups for us, too. Sometimes in large, diverse groups, sometimes in shared apartments with two, the Romanian has proven to be a reliable companion. Together, he can make everyday life in the shelter much more colorful, and he can be encouraged to play around, but he can also calm down on his own and communicate when things get too hectic. Therefore, adoption with an existing first-time dog is a good option.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg
Araxa,Malinois,"11 years",Female,"Araxa is truly unique. As a result of an injury, Araxa's lower lip is no longer fully fused, which makes her look very special. However, this minor handicap doesn't bother or affect Araxa at all. Her future owners should simply place a towel next to the water bowl, because drinking with a lip like that isn't quite as elegant.
Araxa, as is typical of the breed, bonds closely with her caregivers. She enjoys going for walks, already has good basic obedience, and can run off-leash. The senior also enjoys small activities.

Tabaluga,Mischling,"5 years",Male,"Tabaluga kam zu uns ins Tierheim, da sich die privaten Umstände in der Familie geändert haben und auch die Suche nach einem Platz im näheren Bekanntenkreis leider erfolglos blieb. Die neue Situation und der Umzug verunsicherten den Mischlingsrüden erst einmal und er wusste nicht so recht, wohin mit sich. Er suchte oft die Nähe zu uns Pfleger:innen und wir gaben ihm den nötigen Halt. Nun darf er in Ruhe bei uns ankommen und sich an die neue Umgebung gewöhnen.
Im Alltag und besonders draußen zeigt er sich aktuell nicht besonders umweltsicher. Er ist zwar grundsätzlich kein unsicherer oder ängstlicher Hund, vieles bereitet ihm aber Sorge. Dass er kein so armer Knopf ist, wie manche Personen zu Beginn denken, zeigt er recht schnell. Denn wenn er eins kann, dann ist es imponieren. Wenn es nach ihm ginge, so wäre kein Baum und kein Grashalm auf der Strecke unmarkiert – zur Sicherheit am besten mehrfach. Kommt es zu frontalen Begegnungen mit Hunden, Fahrradfahrern oder Joggern, verbellt er diese sehr vehement.
Abgesehen davon zeigt Tabaluga beim Spaziergang insgesamt eine solide Grunderziehung. Er läuft gut an der Leine, kennt den Rückruf, an dessen Verbindlichkeit zwar noch gearbeitet werden muss, und orientiert sich in reizarmen Situationen insgesamt gut an seinem Menschen.
Seine Ambivalenz zeigt sich vor allem im Umgang mit anderen Hunden. Steht eine intakte, meinungsstarke Hündin vor ihm, backt Tabaluga sicherheitshalber ganz kleine Brötchen. Dann hält er Abstand, ist höflich und deeskalierend, statt etwas zu riskieren. Hat er aber einen Rüden vor sich, der sich ebenso zurückhaltend verhält, wie er bei einer Hündin, wächst er über sich hinaus – und das nicht auf die gute Weise. Wird er hier nicht gebremst, sucht er den Konflikt. Selbst wenn sein Gegenüber ganz klar zeigt, dass er keinen Streit sucht, sondern sich immer wieder deeskalierend abwendet.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg

Futomaki,Mischling,"13 years",Female,"Hundeomi Futomaki hat plötzlich und unerwartet ihr letztes Zuhause verloren und wartet nun bei uns darauf erneut entdeckt zu werden. 2012 erblickte sie in Kroatien das Licht der Welt und durfte damals gemeinsam mit ihren Zweibeinern die Koffer packen, um nach Deutschland zu ziehen – nun stehen wir ihr an ihrer Seite, um den hoffentlich letzten Umzug ihres Lebens zu ermöglichen.
Die schwarze Mischlingshündin (mit den mittlerweile auch grauen Häärchen) ist auf dem ersten Blick eine eher unscheinbare Hündin. Sicherlich auch dem fortschreitenden Alter geschuldet genießt sie zunehmend die Zeit im Körbchen und fordert neben den ausgiebigen Streicheleinheiten auch ihre Entspannungszeiten ein. Doch gibt es selbst im Leben der Seniorin noch Phasen, in denen man ihr den Schalk im Nacken anmerkt. Wie auch bei den Menschen fehlt ihr ab und an noch das Verständnis für „die Jugend von heute“. Auch, wenn sie den Umgang mit Kindern kennt, sind ihr Roller oder Skateboards nicht ganz so geheuer. Hier verleiht sie ihrem Unverständnis auch mal lautstark Ausdruck und kann Pöbeln, wie man es ihr niemals zugetraut hätte. Zum Glück kehrt nach einer solchen Meinungsäußerung auch genauso schnell wieder Ruhe ein und Futomaki kann den restlichen Gassigang wieder genießen, als wäre nie etwas passiert.

Crassus,Mischling,"10 years",Male,"Unfortunately, the sensitive mixed-breed dog Crassus is not as self-confident as his name initially suggests. A lack of security and leadership have led him to put himself in the front row and assume the role of ""boss"" – a position he is uncomfortable with and which further increases his insecurity. Unfortunately, he has never been able to learn how to avoid conflicts or resolve them without stress, which is why only ""flight"" or a staged ""attack"" come to mind. If his counterpart appears very self-confident, Crassus is rather subdued. Inhibited people, on the other hand, make the mixed-breed very insecure.
Crassus has now adjusted to his new routine at the animal shelter and is actively involved in training. The lively dog clearly enjoys practicing with his caregivers and enjoys the mental stimulation during walks. Even though training is still completely new territory for Crassus, he tries very hard to please his trainers and is making steady progress. Despite everything, training is an ongoing process, and it takes time to transform an insecure ""leash bully"" into a relaxed and everyday companion. It's time and effort, however, that are worth it and will determine the future relationship between human and dog.
Even though Crassus now responds well to the guidance of his caregivers, he knows exactly what's important to him. Food is a particularly important resource for Crassus, one that he also defended in his last home. He has since learned, step by step, to hold back and wait for permission to eat instead of immediately pouncing on anything edible. Asking questions and being guided by his caregivers is an important task for this guy, and is also regularly practiced during walks. It helps him to hold back and not always see himself as the one in charge. Even during dog encounters, he's becoming increasingly reliable at maintaining his composure, utilizing the support of his leaders.
Becoming this leader requires sensitivity and patience to gain the cautious male's trust. Once this has been achieved, the path to a shared future is paved.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg

Ein wahnsinnig schöner, energetischer Rüde mit wahnsinnig viel Potential für das es aber auch noch einen wahnsinnig langen und wahnsinnig anstrengenden Trainingsweg zu beschreiten gibt, bis man dieses voll entfalten kann.




Neben den allgemeinen Trainingsansätzen gibt es jedoch auch in den Arbeitsbereichen des Drahthaares weiteren Nachholbedarf. Wer sich in Punkto „rassespezifischer Beschäftigung“ auf Dummyarbeit freut wird hier zuerst noch die Fehler der Vergangenheit ausradieren müssen. Das Ziel einer ruhigen, konzentrierten Teamarbeit immer vor Augen kann man mit steigender Bindung und Selbstregulation sicherlich Einiges erreichen, den empfänglich wäre Rainer schon für das Apportieren – fast schon zu viel… Aktuell verliert sich Rainer Wahnsinn noch sehr in der Dynamik und schaukelt sich in einem wahren Suchtverhalten immer weiter hoch.

Paletti,Mischling,"4 years",Female,"Mixed-breed dog Paletti unfortunately has a very typical backstory. She came to Germany from Bulgaria at just a few weeks old and was adopted through another association. From the very beginning, there were minor and major problems, but within her well-established environment, things remained largely calm for the rapidly growing lady, even without training. Due to the advanced age of her previous owners and the associated changes in their daily lives, Paletti ultimately had to move to our animal shelter after the rehoming association saw no other way to find a home for her.
By moving her to us, we are now trying to break the downward spiral in Paletti's life. Unfortunately, Paletti found it difficult for a long time to build a trusting relationship with us and overcome her initial tension. Although she had regularly attended a dog daycare center in the past and was already familiar with being in an enclosure and kennel surrounded by other four-legged friends, it took her a surprisingly long time to settle in. Paletti therefore loves going outside the most. When she's out for a walk, she finds it much easier to switch off and distract herself with the views of the fields and parks. She also enjoys cooperating with her owners, even if they currently feel more like a ""means to an end"" than a fully-fledged caregiver. Well, in short: a typical livestock guardian dog. Initially skeptical and reserved – but actually looking for close social contacts, which we will hopefully soon be able to provide.
For many, however, the dog seems a little ambivalent, and even for us, it was difficult to assess this fine lady at first. Curious, bribable, relaxed, funny, but also at times disinterested or overwhelmed by the unfamiliar surroundings. In the past, there were always set routines, and from a young age, her life took place in her own little world, the house and yard. Aside from trips to doggie daycare, there was little variety in Paletti's routine, as the young livestock guardian could do without visitors, small animals, or other hustle and bustle – something her previous owners did as well. With her natural vocation as a guard dog, this pretty girl can also learn that there are breaks and evenings off, during which she can let her owners decide who is allowed to enter and leave the property and when. She naturally enjoys analyzing her surroundings and is always aware of everything that's happening around her, but with reasonable guidance, she too can understand that there's no reason to interfere.
As her training progresses and old habits are abandoned, we hope, in collaboration with suitable prospective owners, to develop a great future for Paletti, even though the adoption prospects for most adult livestock guardian mixes are already worse than for most other breeds.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg

It is important that his new owners spend enough time with him, stimulate him physically and mentally, and provide him with loving consistency in his training. Hunting imitation games should be avoided due to his breed-specific hunting instinct.
Darius is not yet very good at being alone. But that doesn't mean he can't learn. Nevertheless, it can be difficult for a single person to handle at first. With plenty of time and patience, he can hopefully gain enough trust to be left alone for short periods. In general, Darius loves to bark, which can naturally become a problem in an apartment building.
Darius forms a strong bond with his favorite people and wants to protect them – including his property. Children should not live in his home.

Leider hat Flo dadurch sein Vertrauen in den Menschen verloren und gelernt, bei allem, was ihm Angst macht, nach vorne zu gehen. Was aber nicht bedeutet, dass Flo nicht vermittelbar ist. Sein Pflegefrauchen kann alles mit ihm machen, dort zeigt er sich als ganz verschmuster, lustiger Kerl.
Flo ist eine Aufgabe, die viel Spaß bringen kann, wenn man Zeit und Geduld hat und sich auf positives Training einlässt. Es ist wunderbar, wenn aus so einem kleinen unsicheren Energiebündel dann ein Hund wird, der sich auf seine Menschen verlassen kann.
UPDATE (Juni 2025): Ein unglaublich süßer Troll, aber er hat seine Macken z.B. mit fremden Leuten, Tierarzt und Fahrradfahrern. Wobei er viele Sachen mitlerweile gut meistert.","Mitteldorfstraße 2, 37127 Niemetal, Deutschland",Aktiv für Hunde in Not e.V.

Jamy is a dog with a lot of temperament and energy. He knows basic commands, is house trained and gets along well with bitches and neutered males off the leash. However, Jamy has a real problem on the leash when meeting other dogs and is leash aggressive. Here he uses all his physical strength and it is difficult to get him out of this state of excitement. Jamy is familiar with dog training and should continue to attend dog training. So far he has not found a way to cope with his frustration. So he is a dog with areas to work on. This requires understanding, dog experience and perseverance. Jamy will thank you for these three things with his endless love and as a best friend. Due to his breed bond, he has a lot of drive and a willingness to work and learn.

His new owners should have experience with more difficult dogs and be equally active—he has a lot of energy. Timba would like to move into a home with a fenced yard.

Crowds, confined spaces, and unfortunately, even children, cause him stress. If you enjoy the tranquility of nature and like a cozy home, then the ideal companion is waiting for you here. With strangers and dogs, Pino initially requests his personal space and is wary of strangers. If you don't pressure him, you've taken the first step toward becoming his friend.

To live a long and as healthy a life as possible, Thea needs continued support in the form of nutritional supplements and physical therapy to build muscle.

Bibo,Mischling,"3 years",Male,"Mixed-breed male Bibo, estimated to be about three years old, came to the shelter this summer as a stray. Therefore, nothing can be said about his past. Initially, he spent a few days with his finders. Apparently, no one misses Bibo. In the shelter, the young male gives the impression that he hasn't experienced much in his life yet. Therefore, there is a lot of catching up to do.
It is questionable whether he can be left alone. He acts very excitedly around strangers and barks at them. This initial skepticism eventually subsides. Once Bibo has thawed out, he reveals himself to be an open-minded young dog who enjoys being petted.
Overall, Bibo is rather skeptical of everything new, so he needs to be introduced to many things gradually, such as silent encounters on a leash. He gets along quite well with other dogs, depending on their sympathy. There should be no children in his new home, as this would certainly be overwhelming for everyone involved.

Cub,Malinois-Mix,"2 years",Male,"Young Cub came to us as a stray. He's a Malinois mix, a dedicated working dog, and despite his young age, he's already exhibiting problematic behaviors that urgently need to be addressed: He's sensitive to stress and is completely overstimulated in the shelter, making it difficult for him to calm down. At the same time, he's also very sensitive and doesn't tolerate pressure—he tends to engage in displacement behaviors, biting things nearby (including trouser legs, etc.). He also hasn't yet learned to be friendly toward strangers and other dogs. He needs to be handled confidently so he can become more relaxed in new situations. Currently, the mere sight of other people triggers him to attack while on the leash.
Cub is very attentive, docile, and eager to work. He is looking for a home with dedicated people who will keep him meaningfully occupied and busy, and ideally have experience with working dogs. Due to his existing behavioral problems, he is NOT suitable for protection dog sports. However, a calm, focused dog sport would be perfect for him. Mantrailing or Hoopers, for example, are suitable for this. Cub already knows basic commands like sit and stay, but he doesn't yet carry them out with concentration with us. We are working on his leash training, and he also enjoys being taught new things by his owners. In general, he forms a strong bond with ""his owners"" after the second introduction.
Cub is still young, boisterous, and somewhat boisterous. With the right training and experienced people, he can become a truly good friend and ""work colleague."" He is not a family dog and unfortunately not suited to living with children. He handles muzzle training well. He is probably only partially suitable as a second dog—but with experienced people and a good getting-to-know-you phase, we can imagine him also moving in with a confident first dog of a suitable age/size/temperament.
Typical for the breed, he is protective of family and property and needs a quieter residential area on the outskirts of town. He is not suited to the bustling city, as he cannot process the many stimuli and reacts with strong displacement behavior. Because his bones are still developing, he shouldn't climb too many stairs.","Hausvaterweg 39, 13057 Berlin, Germany",Tierheim Berlin

Cody,Französische Bulldoge,"5 years",Male,"Cody is currently housed in a boarding facility and is receiving a lot of training there: In the dog group, he is social when his owner can give him the appropriate guidance on how to behave with new friends. However, in a domestic setting, he is still a challenge and requires a lot of forward-looking management. He is currently in North Rhine-Westphalia and must be visited there as well. Please contact us if you are interested in Cody.
Cody was surrendered to the animal shelter because his previous owners were overwhelmed. He has bitten people several times, even within his own family. Despite his small size, Cody is a difficult dog, and we will only place him in experienced hands. He defends resources such as food and toys, which is why imitation hunting games are taboo for him. Visits to the vet are an absolute abomination for Cody and are only possible with a muzzle, which he has now associated with positive things and wears very reliably. He has elevated liver values, but is well controlled with medication and currently has no further problems. He will receive free liver treatment at our veterinary practice for life.
This little male is very personable and generally affectionate with people he knows. However, he doesn't like being touched on his back, in the lumbar region, or on his tail—he will then attack without warning. Some malformed vertebrae in his spine suggest that touching this area hurts him.
Cody walks well on a leash and can be led past anyone and everything on walks without any problem. Other dogs are perfectly fine, depending on how well they get along—you don't have to like everyone, but if there's a good enough affinity, we would also be happy to find him a second dog, for example, to a confident and well-socialized female dog.

I'm an active, playful, and cuddly companion who loves life and wants to stick by my human through thick and thin. I'm looking for a loving forever home – a place where I can arrive, find security, and where my humans will guide me through life with heart, patience, and clear leadership. Ideally with you!!! My human and our behavior trainer, Lili. Depending on compatibility, I also get along with other dogs. Children, cats, and other small animals shouldn't be in my home. I would be ideally suited to a couple or a single person with several years of experience with dogs. I'm currently in the typical ""rebellious"" phase – right in the middle of that exciting time where I'm testing my limits. Therefore, I wish for a person who will take on the role of pack leader: someone who will show me, with loving consistency, clarity, and patience, what is allowed – and what isn't. I need structure, security, and someone I can look to for guidance. Then I will quickly grow into a reliable and well-balanced companion. My basic commands aren't perfect yet, but I am intelligent, attentive, and eager to learn. I am being rehomed through the animal welfare organization SOS Vergessene Pfoten Tierschutz e.V. (SOS Forgotten Paws Animal Welfare) with a protection contract and for a rehoming fee of €550. I am, of course, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, neutered, and already registered with Tasso. You can purchase a suitable safety harness, a regular harness, a collar, and a leash (all in good condition) for me from our organization. This starter kit ensures that I feel safe, secure, and well cared for from the very beginning. Do you have a place in your heart and on your sofa? Then don't wait any longer. I'm looking forward to meeting you. We would be delighted if you followed us in the Facebook group, on Instagram, and on TikTok.

Neutered male Mio is a Border Collie, German Shepherd, and Labrador mix, and a real unlucky dog. Not only is he black, which unfortunately still leaves him with a poor chance of being adopted, but he's also mostly experienced the downsides of his life so far. He's now 8 years old, and has spent 7 of those years in poor conditions, including 1 year in an animal shelter.
Mio came to us at the animal shelter in poor nutritional condition. He previously lived on a property with 7 dogs and learned what hunger means. This left its mark on him, and he can develop food aggression toward other dogs. And there's another thing Mio doesn't like at all. Loud men and the smell of alcohol. This, too, has something to do with his previous behavior.
It's all the more surprising that Mio is a really happy dog. Every morning, he's overjoyed to see us and go outside. He loves going for walks, loves water, puddles, digging, and rolling in the grass.

Children should not live in the household. Ares is already quite capable: He's house-trained and used to riding in a car. He's also an athletic and alert dog who looks forward to many active hours with the right people.
Due to his sometimes unusual behavior, Ares' adoption is supported by our dog trainer. Several visits to our shelter are necessary so that prospective adopters and our shelter pet can get to know each other in his familiar surroundings. After adoption, attendance at a suitable dog (owner) school is essential. Our animal caretakers will be happy to advise you.
Ares had a special castration procedure, during which both his testicle and his uterus were removed. His animal caretakers will be happy to answer any questions you may have. Otherwise, this handsome dog is very fit and alert.
Please note that Ares is one of the so-called listed dogs, meaning his ownership is prohibited in Brandenburg and is subject to proof of competence in Berlin. Furthermore, muzzles and leashes are mandatory in Berlin.","Hausvaterweg 39, 13057 Berlin, Germany",Tierheim Berlin

Despite her medium size, Pille has a lot of strength and definitely needs to be trained, especially when walking on a leash. She's definitely not a couch potato and wants to experience a lot. Dog sports would certainly be interesting for her.
People with experience with herding dogs would be a great fit for Pille, because this opinionated little mouse is not for beginners. We're currently practicing reliably wearing a muzzle with her when we go for walks.

Fina,franz. Bulldogge,"7 years",Female,"Fina had already been adopted, but she returned after 6 months because she was able to successfully take over in her new home! Fina is NOT a dog for beginners! If not guided consistently, Fina likes to take matters into her own hands and manage resources and space. The princess status often associated with this breed is poison for Finchen and goes to her head. Without a stable companion, she quickly becomes a terror queen who rules her family on her terms. She needs clear body language and rules. She sees purely positive training methods based on positive conditioning and treats as a weakness and will question them after a short time. Here with us, she works well in the dog group. However, it must also be clear that the human is leading the group. Once she has found her place and knows that she is not under the control of the owner, she is a cuddly, friendly dog who enjoys walks, can be left alone, and also rides well in the car. Unfortunately, she has developed an allergy and is given a tablet twice a day. This means she is symptom-free. She also has bilateral keratoconjunctivitis sicca, meaning she doesn't produce tears, which, if left untreated, leads to painful irritation and itching. Therefore, she needs to apply eye ointment several times a day, which she tolerates well. Fina is neutered. Cats and small animals should not live in her new home. She will also not be rehomed with children. She wears a muzzle without any problems, which she will continue to need in certain situations (e.g., at the vet).","Liebigstraße 51, 47608 Geldern, Germany",Tierheim Geldern

Aldrin,Herdenschutzhund Mix,"5 years",Male,"Aldrin is an imposing figure, but a real bundle of joy at around 50 kg. As a puppy, he was probably hit by a car in a parking lot in Albania. Since then, he has had a slight walking disability and is missing a few toes on one hind foot. He underwent cruciate ligament surgery in Austria, and everything has healed well. In any case, he's happily romping through the meadows here. He has a sweet, sunny disposition, and with that, he's won the hearts of the people here. He spent the last year in Austria with a family that had another dog, a small child, and other animals. The family was very sad that they couldn't keep Aldrin, but their circumstances have changed. We would like to find a home for Aldrin with a fenced yard where he can continue his herd protection duties. We're looking for people who might be comfortable with the dog not wanting to go for walks for two to three hours a day, who can allow him freedom outside, but still offer a close family connection in the house. Depending on the dog's affinity, Aldrin can also be placed with another dog. Aldrin takes his livestock guardianship duties seriously, but he enjoys being guided and even directed. Simply letting him run around and make his own decisions can sometimes lead in the wrong direction. Therefore, we're looking for people with livestock guardian dog experience—or people who are familiar with the process and who can and are willing to maintain a clear line. So, back to the topic of children: family members are loved and sometimes protected. When unfamiliar children come to visit, things can get a bit louder, rougher, and more hectic. When Aldrin tries to sort through what he sees as chaos, it could lead to misunderstandings—and that's not what you want. Therefore, forward-looking management is required that doesn't cause stress for either the dog or the humans. Aldrin needs time to adjust to new situations. It would be nice if his new owners could get to know Aldrin through a few visits, so that some trust is established on both sides before he moves in. He settled in quite quickly at the shelter and actually really liked the people here. We hope that he will soon become a happy dog in his new home, with his people, house, and property.

Milo,Appenzeller Sennenhund,"6 years",Male,"Milo's past has been very low-stimulation. Acquired as a puppy, he quickly lost interest, and he remained on the farm. Getting to know the world and the various environmental stimuli associated with it – no chance. When he bit a family member one day, he was sent to the animal shelter.
Generally, Milo's frustration tolerance is very low, meaning that even the smallest triggers are enough to quickly overwhelm him, trigger frustration, and result in (redirected) aggression. The triggers are very different, e.g. the treat is not pushed through the muzzle quickly enough, strange dogs, sometimes even when several people he knows are in the room. Due to his problem behavior, he will not be rehomed in a family with children. Experienced dog owners are needed here, who ideally have already gained experience with this type of problem behavior. Clear rules and boundaries are essential for Milo, and the new two-legged friend must be able to offer him secure leadership and continue to work on his problems. If he knows his people and trusts them, he will be a loyal companion.
Even though Milo has a low frustration tolerance, he does well in training if there are no distractions. ""Sit,"" ""down,"" and ""stay"" work wonderfully, but he still needs more practice walking properly on a leash, for example. He really enjoys playing foraging games. His leash aggression and resource guarding also need further work.

This handsome mixed breed is still a very active, strong, and spirited dog.

Baghira continues to bring great joy to his walker, whom he has known for years, and is making good progress.

He really enjoys playing forage games—he comes alive when challenged and likes to show off his skills. He also enjoys bathing, and he's usually friendly with other dogs. Once he's settled in, being left alone for hours at a time will need to be practiced consistently—he barked frequently with his previous owner. He generally tends to bark when overwhelmed.

I know and wear the muzzle very well and am easy to handle in many situations. In other situations, I display strong stress behavior and sometimes even tend to engage in displacement behavior.

Blue,Staffordshire-Mix,"10 years",Male,"Blue came to us after being confiscated for violating animal protection laws. Unfortunately, he has a history of biting people. This powerful male dog is very distrustful of strangers. He is easily hand-fed by his caregivers, which motivates him. Other dogs still quickly overwhelm him, but he has now learned to walk calmly in a group of dogs. The only important thing is that he walks in front of the other dogs. He wears his muzzle well; he has associated it with positive feelings. Blue is undergoing behavioral therapy with us and is making good progress. He particularly enjoys the therapy sessions on the water treadmill—and since he already has some minor orthopedic problems with his musculoskeletal system, regular gentle exercise in the water is particularly beneficial for him.
Otherwise, Blue is more of a ""couch potato"" type—he likes it warm and cozy. He is prone to obesity, so his new owners will have to keep an eye on this. Due to his musculoskeletal problems, he shouldn't be overweight.
Blue is only suitable for very experienced Staffie owners who already have experience with dogs that have bitten people. New owners must be able and willing to work with him accordingly. Children and other animals should not live in the household. Blue is also not at all suitable for the inner city; a home in the countryside or at most on the outskirts of town would be ideal. We also recommend regular attendance at a good dog training school. Interested parties should be able to visit Blue several times at the animal shelter so he can get used to them and gain trust. Due to his breed and history, landlord permission is required in many places, and he must be muzzled and kept on a leash in public.
If you would like to give Blue the right home or have any questions, please contact us at tiervermittlung@tierschutz-berlin.de, describing your living circumstances and previous dog experience, along with a meaningful email address and a callback number, or carefully fill out the form below. You are also welcome to call us. Please contact his animal caretakers at the Reha-Haus at +49 30 76 888-204.

Schelly,Mischling,"2 years",Female,"A little rescue!
Schelly is about 2 years old, spayed, and approximately 40 cm tall. Unfortunately, Schelly hasn't had a very good life so far.

This mixed-breed dog also has an old injury-related hip problem, which currently only minimally affects her gait.

Schelly shouldn't be physically overexerted. We're therefore looking for a quiet home for her, preferably on the ground floor or with an elevator. Rough play with other dogs or children would not be suitable. Instead, Schelly needs mental stimulation, as she's still quite a young dog. She currently has a short haircut.

Hatschi,American Akita,"6 years",Male,"Hatschi was confiscated for violating animal protection laws. Unfortunately, things were far from perfect in his past, but he's developed superbly with us. He's a very typical representative of his breed, and Akita lovers will truly enjoy him.
He's quite reserved, even neutral, towards strangers and takes a while to get to know new people. Once he's gotten to know them and gained their trust, he's an absolutely loyal companion—he's certainly taken all of his keepers and dog walkers to his heart. He knows the muzzle, which he's developed a positive association with us, and wears it very confidently. He knows basic commands and enjoys working with his owners for praise and food. Outside, he's very neutral towards strangers and dogs and is easy to lead—he's often particularly charming with female dogs. However, on walks, you notice that Hatschi hasn't been socialized well enough and often reacts quite fearfully. For example, he is startled by mallards taking flight at a pond, and many environmental stimuli that should be natural for well-socialized dogs are ""not entirely comfortable"" with him. However, he never reacts aggressively in such situations; instead, he tends to retreat. We are therefore confident that with the right people at his side, he will find the world less scary with each passing month.
Due to his past, he is not suited to life in the city or a household with children or a lot of hustle and bustle. Quiet, dog-experienced people at his side who can give him trust and security would be just right for Hatschi. A confident female dog in the household would also offer him a lot of guidance. In his last known home, he unfortunately bit his owner's friend when he was harassed. Therefore, you should be aware that, as a stranger, you should not simply touch Hatschi. Akita friends will know this and be able to appreciate it well.
We expect that once Hatschi has settled in, he'll become a very relaxed, calm roommate and can easily be left alone for a few hours. We hope this sweet, curious boy finally gets his well-deserved ""happy ending"" – ideally in the suburbs or a rural location.","Hausvaterweg 39, 13057 Berlin, Germany",Tierheim Berlin

I generally find cats interesting, but sometimes my hunting instinct comes out, which can certainly be managed with some training, as I'm very affectionate and not aggressive. I'm looking for people who have the time, patience, and joy to grow with me. Attending dog training classes would be perfect so I can learn even more and develop into a truly wonderful companion. If you're looking for an affectionate, active, and intelligent friend who will give you their heart, then I'm the perfect companion for you.

Kamal,Schäferhund-Mix,"8 years",Male,"The beautiful Kamal comes from Ukraine and came to us via a seizure. He initially lived here with his girlfriend (the blonde dog in the pictures) – the two recovered from the traumatic events of their past under the loving care of their carers. The dog has since moved out, and Kamal is still looking for his new owners.
Kamal has an incredibly sad story: He and his girlfriend Sonya were probably originally street dogs. At some point, they were captured and taken to Kyiv's municipal animal shelter, Borodyanka. When the city came under fire in the spring of 2022, the director of the shelter and her staff fled the premises, leaving the animals locked up and uncared for. For five weeks, no one cared for the 485 dogs, among others. Only about 260 of them survived the gruesome ordeal; Kamal and Sonya were among the lucky ones. After their rescue, they lived for a few weeks at the home of a Ukrainian animal rights activist in Kyiv, who arranged a final home for them in the Netherlands—at least, that was the plan. On the way to the Netherlands, however, they were stranded in Berlin because one of the volunteer drivers for the onward transport had dropped out at short notice. Ultimately, the dogs were confiscated by the veterinary office and taken to an animal shelter. They were both still far too thin and extremely timid—no wonder. They have escaped the dog hell on earth.
After some time with us, with lots of good food, medical care, and attention, Kamal is finally ready to move into his forever home. This handsome male is a sweet, personable dog when trusted, but he is very difficult outside. Kamal is currently undergoing muzzle training with us because, on walks, he resolutely moves forward when passing strangers and dogs. Intensive individual work using humane methods with a good dog trainer is therefore strongly recommended. Kamal hasn't experienced much in his life so far, but he's trying very hard to understand what people want from him. Being left alone with other dogs is no problem, but whether he can stay completely alone would have to be tested and trained accordingly. Kamal sometimes reacts uncertainly and fearfully in new situations, and he panics at the vet. 🙁 A lot of sensitive, patient training will be necessary here to take some of the fear out of the necessary vet visits. If Kamal feels threatened, he might snap out of fear—he doesn't mean any harm. He defends his food. Who could blame him, after what he's been through?
Kamal is very happy to move in with a nice, confident female dog as a second dog. He likes his female companions very much, but with males, it's all about sympathy.","Hausvaterweg 39, 13057 Berlin, Germany",Tierheim Berlin
Pepito,Cane Corso,"4 years",Male,"Pepito came from a seizure of several Cane Corsos in August 2023.
Until his seizure, Pepito only knew life in a stable with an adjacent run in his previous group (pack housing). He didn't know a leash or the usual basic commands, such as eating from a food bowl, car rides, the inside of a house, etc.


When out for walks without major distractions, Pepito is mostly easy to walk on a leash. If he feels stressed, he may circle you – we still recommend using a safety harness (or a GPS tracker if necessary).","Augustfehner Straße 8, 26670 Uplengen, Germany",Tierheim Jübberde

Miko,Border Collie Mix,"7 years",Male,"Miko originally came from an animal protection organization abroad and was surrendered because he had bitten several times in the past. In the shelter, he gets along well with other male and female dogs, but due to his behavior towards people, he is better kept as an only dog. If he feels threatened, he reacts with noticeable aggression. However, he wears his muzzle reliably and will likely need it in various everyday situations.
Miko is a very sensitive dog who needs calm people who he can look up to. He already knows some basic commands and is house-trained. He is used to riding in the car, jumps into the car crate, and is calm during the journey. He has also shown himself to be very good on a leash in the shelter. He also loves water.
Our Miko is not a cuddly dog, but he wants to be close to his caregivers. He enjoys spending his breaks with his animal keepers at the shelter. He has difficulty dealing with stress and frustration and needs careful management, for example, when it comes to feeding. He defends resources and his territory.
Miko is not a dog for a hectic life in the city or an apartment building, where he encounters people he cannot avoid every day in confined spaces in the hallway and/or elevator. Simply ""tolerating"" situations is very difficult for him. He is therefore looking for a home in a more rural, quiet environment with a house or apartment with a separate entrance.","Hausvaterweg 39, 13057 Berlin, Germany",Tierheim Berlin

Blue knows basic commands such as sit and stay, but he still needs a certain amount of basic training regarding his behavior. He currently defends what he considers a boundary violation with growling and defensive, threatening body language, so he is currently only walked with a muzzle, which is not a problem for him. He is a very intelligent and eager-to-learn dog with a considerable hunting instinct, who, with appropriate training, will grow into a very confident dog. For Blue, we're looking for a home with a lot of dog experience, without children, where we can continue to work with him, possibly with professional support. His compatibility with other dogs is based on sympathy, although female dogs are more likely to score points here.","Koppelweide 3, 51674 Wiehl, Germany",Tierheim Koppelweide

His new home must offer the opportunity to handle him with safety training (we trained him to wear a muzzle and leash without contact). A fence system is therefore required where Donnie can be kept in contact with people, yet shielded from direct confrontation. A kennel (with a heated indoor enclosure) and, ideally, a dog room with outdoor access are ideal for this.
Donnie was found abandoned. This handsome mixed breed is a very lively, strong, and people-oriented guy who tries very hard to please his two-legged friends. He is used to and loves riding in cars. He can easily run along with familiar dogs.
For Donnie, we are looking for active people with dog experience who can spend a lot of time with him and who feel confident about a four-legged friend with plenty of energy and a hunting instinct.

Graf has difficulty dealing with stress and is prone to displacement behavior or aggression, and can therefore only be rehomed with dog professionals.
Although he is used to walking with a dog group, he will only be rehomed as a single dog. Unfortunately, he dislikes strange dogs at all, but can be led past them with the necessary distance. He also knows basic commands.

Charles,Dogo Canario,"10 years",Male,"Charles, real name PRINCE Charles, came to us after being confiscated for violating animal protection laws. This handsome brindle male dog doesn't like strangers. He is very friendly with familiar people and enjoys being petted and receiving attention. He connects with women more quickly than with men. Despite this soft inner core, you have to earn his trust. He is aggressive towards both other dogs and strangers—whether passersby or joggers—and should not be underestimated: Charles knows how big and powerful he is. He also dislikes children, neither on the street nor in his home.
Therefore, he needs a human who won't be intimidated or unsettled by this. He must always wear a muzzle when walking, but walks well on a leash as long as he can keep a distance of 5 meters from other dogs. He gets along well with female dogs if they like him, but should preferably live alone in his new home. He chases cats and usually doesn't react at all to birds. The male has discovered his great love in the water: He loves to swim and jumps into his pool with great joy.
Generally speaking, Charles is a smart, eager-to-learn dog with whom there is certainly still a lot to learn. Therefore, we are only rehoming him with confident owners who are experienced with dogs and already know how to deal with difficult and large dogs. He needs a home in a more rural setting, ideally a house with a securely fenced garden. Children should not live in the household. Charles's adjustment period will be rather lengthy and difficult; he often reacts insecurely and stressed in unfamiliar surroundings and when the light changes, so he will need time to settle in. However, he can also be left alone for a few hours. Although Charles is often seen as a pure guard dog due to his size, we do not want to rehome him as such, but rather as a member of the family. This handsome male wants to be close to his people. Please plan several visits to the shelter to get to know him. Charles will only be adopted after a preliminary check. Furthermore, the veterinary office will be informed of his future stay based on his medical history.
We are certain: There is a perfect home for Charles, too. Do you have any questions or are you interested?

Ängstlicher Loki sucht Pflegestelle oder Zuhause,Mischling,"4 years",Male,"Loki is one of nine puppies we took in from Croatia, along with their mother. The large family was found in a Croatian junkyard – their luck, because otherwise they would hardly have survived. Loki came to our farm in May and spent weeks trembling in his basket, afraid of everyone and everything. Since then, we've trained Loki a lot, all at his own pace, and he's become more outgoing and enjoys spending time with his people (he has a few favorites). He needs lots of cuddles and spends a lot of time with us around the farm so he can get to know everything. He now lets us put a harness on him and can even go for short walks with his familiar people. Loki is still a fearful dog. He's afraid of every noise and stranger and retreats, but then he comes out again because he is somewhat curious. He trusts his people so much that he no longer needs to hide completely. He's already been around an apartment and gotten used to getting into a car, which he still finds scary. Everything is being practiced slowly and at his own pace. Anyone who wants to meet Loki will need to come here often to build the necessary trust. We would like Loki to have a house or apartment with a garden, as he won't be able to go for walks at first. It should be in a quiet, rural location; calm children aged 12 and up would be fine. Experience with fearful dogs is a must. Unfortunately, we don't know how he reacts to cats. He enjoys the company of smaller dogs, especially females. If there's already a small, confident dog in the household, that would be ideal. Loki still needs to learn all the basics of dog training, very slowly. It will be tiring and challenging, and there may always be setbacks. He's not yet house-trained, as he's never lived in an apartment before. Who would like to give Loki a chance and get to know him?

Michel,Kaukasischer Owtscharka,"6 years",Male,"This handsome male is currently a shell of his former self. Without a firm footing in life, he doesn't yet know what to do. Bought as an eight-week-old puppy, Michel was meant to do exactly what a livestock guardian is meant to do – guard goats and the property that surrounds them. A dog that is allowed to do the exact job for which its breed was originally bred is something we certainly welcome – but only if it is approached correctly.  Unfortunately, this was not the case in Michel's case.  Apart from the two Ovcharka bitches that also lived on the property, as well as the owners and their families, Michel didn't get to know anything (apart from his job of guarding). So Michel lived and functioned within his system until the mood changed.
After a full-blown bite incident, his fear of the male dog became too great. Michel was locked away on the farm. As is typical for many dogs for whom we and other animal shelters across Germany request placement, in Michel's case, too, the authorities did not want to tackle the problem together with the dog. Experts called in spoke out against official euthanasia because the dog was not dangerous. So Michel remained in his shed until the authorities insisted that he be surrendered.
Without any environmental socialization, the imposing male dog was completely shocked by the existence of a world outside his garden. Since arriving at the animal shelter, Michel has repeatedly faced what he sees as insurmountable hurdles. Even the slightest touch of his collar, people in his kennel, pulling on the leash, or similar things that are normally everyday for dogs trigger panic in Michel, flight, and, in certain situations, defensive behavior. Michel was not allowed to experience anything, never learned how to learn, and on the other hand, never had to endure anything. As a result, he has no problem-solving skills or problem-management skills.
Even though Michel's claws have already left a few dents in our lives, we agree with the expert opinion that prevented Michel's death and are happy that we can now show him the world. We're already seeing initial successes, and the progress is in some cases greater and faster than expected. Nevertheless, it requires patience, perseverance, and a well-fitting muzzle from everyone involved.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg

After a period of adjustment, he has shown himself to be a willing learner who is friendly and obedient to people he trusts. His exuberant nature and working with him are great fun.
In his previous life, he only ever trusted a very few select people, whom he had known since his puppyhood. His insecurity probably led him to try to bite. He rarely allowed strangers to visit him. His previous home was probably too unsafe for him, which rubbed off on him. With secure and confident guidance, Klaus can also relax and accepts this gratefully. Nevertheless, you should be aware that Klaus may be prone to jealousy again in his new home.
At just under 40 kilos, further work should be done on his leash training. He's used to being left alone for hours at a time, as well as traveling in cars, buses, and trains. He's generally friendly toward other dogs, but can, of course, be provoked by large, fussy males. Since Klaus is an intelligent little fellow, he can also open doors and jump over fences.

The sad thing about such unfortunate chain of events is that information about the dog gets lost, and you end up with a veritable mosaic of behaviors whose rationale isn't always immediately apparent. For example, Ares chooses his own caregivers and terrorizes the rest by jumping on the bars, threatening, and attacking. For this reason, Ares has already been fitted with a muzzle by the shelter, and he wears it without any problems. When Ares was with us, he displayed insecure behavior and immediately reacted to harassment with an attack. Unfortunately, this is a common behavior in dogs who, due to too many changes of owners, have developed attachment disorders and social neglect because they never really had a chance to put down roots. This means that dogs like Ares begin to develop their own strategies with which they think they can solve their problems and worries. Of course, ""attack is never the best defense,"" and so people who adopt Ares shouldn't assume that he means it in a bad way, but rather that he simply can't do anything else in some situations because no one has ever taught him how. A dog like Ares should therefore be given to very responsible owners who don't see the muzzle as a punishment, but rather as an opportunity to accompany their dog in his development process responsibly and safely for everyone. Because when Ares attacks, he doesn't need to resist, nor does he need a person nearby who gets scared and becomes hysterical. He needs to learn that his behavior is undesirable and be prevented from escalating further. In our case, we were able to achieve this by intercepting Ares in the act of attack and placing him by his collar in front of us. Since he didn't expect such a reaction, he looked at us briefly, which we used as an opportunity to send him away and to convey to him that he wasn't allowed to be there when he behaved like that. So you pull him back from his attack and threaten him away. As soon as he lets go of his perceived opponent and evades the body language threat, it's just as important to invite him back into the situation with a gentle body language gesture and let him participate again. You don't want to punish him, but simply show him which behavior is desired and which undesirable. Dogs communicate analogically – that is, they indicate their state of mind and intentions through body language, facial expressions, and gestures. It's always said that where the nose points, the dog is thinking. If he looks at the sausage, he'll eat it; if he looks into the woods, you'll go for a walk alone shortly afterward because Waldi is hunting. This also applies to Ares, but his flat muzzle and curled tail mean that many people don't understand him well, which is another reason why his speech and actions often seem a bit exaggerated. If you're not understood, you just raise your voice. Ares, because he's been passed around so much in his short life, is a lone fighter who looks out for his own skin first and foremost. Typical of a bulldog, he remains very stubborn and defends himself according to the motto ""attack is the best defense."" People who want to give Ares a home need knowledge of expressive behavior and communication. Furthermore, a high degree of responsibility is required to avoid Ares being classified as a dangerous dog. Unfortunately, it happens all too often that dogs are given too much perceived freedom out of pity and then fall back into old habits. Otherwise, he's easy to handle in all other everyday situations and can handle a lot. He rides well in the car, he's cuddly, he eats well, and he loves to sleep. He loves walks as much as treats. Strangers, pushy, and aggressive dogs quickly have an ""Aha!"" moment... smarter through ouch, in other words. For Ares, we wish for a home that looks with an unclouded view at the nature and character of such an involuntary vagabond and recognizes and takes seriously his potential.","Koppelweide 3, 51674 Wiehl, Germany",Tierheim Koppelweide
Anton,Malinois,"8 years",Male,"



Anton came to us at the animal shelter as a stray. This lively male is a very alert, affectionate dog who would uncompromisingly defend his owner against strangers and makes this very clear when on a leash. He is house-trained, knows basic commands, is familiar with car rides, and gives up his toys on command. He is very easy to motivate with toys and food and has already made great progress. We suspect that he can be left alone for up to three hours.
We would like to rehome Anton with a single owner, as he unconditionally defends his owner. His new owner should already have experience with his breed and difficult dogs, and should be confident and responsible. A house with a securely fenced yard is also required. Children should not live in the household. At the animal shelter, he gets along well with female dogs.","Hausvaterweg 39, 13057 Berlin, Germany",Tierheim Berlin
Nero,Staffordshire-Terrier-Mix,"8 years",Male,"Please note: Nero is only suitable for keeping in a shelter-like environment. His new home must offer the opportunity to handle him with safety training (contact-free muzzle and leash training, as we have trained him to do). A fence system is therefore necessary where Nero can be kept in contact with people, but still shielded from direct confrontation. A kennel (with a heated indoor enclosure) and, ideally, a dog room with outdoor access are ideal for this.
Nero came to us via a seizure. A lot has gone wrong with this handsome guy so far. He has had five previous owners, and there have been several serious biting incidents. Now he's landed with us, and we sincerely hope that even a dog like him will be able to have a fresh start outside of our shelter.
Nero is quite annoyed by people, their strange, unpredictable behavior, and generally all the back and forth of his past, and his frustration tolerance towards people is correspondingly very low. He lacks the trust that the other end of the leash can also offer understanding, clear structure, and security. He ALWAYS needs a muzzle when interacting with people, even with his closest caregivers. When out for walks, he tends to change his orientation in certain situations. Once he's settled in, he can easily be left alone for about six hours and is also used to riding on public transport. Generally, Nero enjoys walks and contact with his caregivers. He's also easy to walk on a leash and can behave well on walks.
We know that Nero will never be suitable for an ordinary household. Unfortunately, far too much has gone wrong in his past, leading to irreversible mistrust. Nevertheless, we hope that Nero will have his own home outside of our shelter, with more individual attention and daily walks with dog experts who have appropriate facilities for keeping dangerous dogs.","Hausvaterweg 39, 13057 Berlin, Germany",Tierheim Berlin
Buddy,Schäferhund - Mix,"7 years",Male,"Buddy has been living with us at the animal shelter for almost five years now, far too long in our opinion. Like so many black dogs, he is often overlooked.
Buddy has grown older now. Despite his age, Buddy loves long walks and enjoys activities that also challenge him mentally.
Buddy knows all the basic commands, but he is very aware of who he should follow them with and who he shouldn't. He is a very intelligent dog, and therefore consistent and clear handling is important for him. 
Buddy needs 2-3 walks to get to know a new person. Once he has met that person, he is the most loyal companion you could wish for. Buddy is a big water baby and loves to swim. He also loves to fetch balls in the water.","Am Tierheim 4, 74564 Crailsheim, Deutschland",Tierschutzverein Crailsheim - Tierheim e.V.

Baddy is a lively, self-confident fellow. He is house-trained and knows basic commands. Whether he can be left alone and ride well in the car will need to be tested and, if necessary, patiently practiced.
At first, Baddy was difficult to handle with us. He hates strangers and unfamiliar things and gets stressed easily. Out of insecurity, he tends to go forward with strangers—there is a risk that he might bite. He is friendly with people he knows.
We are looking for an experienced home for Baddy in a quiet, low-stress environment. Children should not live in the household. Several visits to gain Baddy's trust will be necessary.

Gino,Mischling ,"4 years",Male,"SOS Forgotten Paws e.V.

My name is Gino, and according to the vet, I was born in June 2021. At 53 cm, I'm quite small for a livestock guardian dog. But I have a heart of gold! Since I'm a herding dog, you should already have a lot of experience with dogs and be very familiar with my breed. To make life easier for us both, my specific needs in everyday life should be taken into account. Because I'm still very agile and full of motivation, my training needs to be consistent but loving. According to the breed description, I should be vigilant and protective, which I am to some extent when it comes to other dogs. I get along better with smaller dogs than with larger ones. But even here, it always depends on whether we get along. For this, I need consistent leadership and clear rules. With the right people by my side and enough to keep me busy, I will be a loyal companion. Otherwise, I am incredibly loyal and loving. I look forward to discovering the world with you and having a loving, safe home where I can feel secure. I am naturally cuddly and love spending time with my humans and older, steady, dog-experienced children. My friendly nature will make it easy for you to feel completely at ease around me. Unfortunately, I haven't met any cats yet, and a house with a secure fence is essential. My dog walker, Jenni, always says I'm a fantastic guy. And yes, what can I say? Soon you'll see us both on TV on Vox. We're looking forward to meeting you, Gino and Jenni!!!
I am being rehomed through the animal welfare organization SOS Vergessene Pfoten Tierschutz e.V. with a protection contract and for a protection fee of €550. I am, of course, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, neutered, and already registered with Tasso. You can purchase a brand-new safety harness, collar, and leash that fit me perfectly from our rescue organization. This starter kit will ensure that I feel safe, secure, and well cared for right from the beginning. So, have I piqued your interest? Then you should give us a call and arrange a visit to see me in Hagen. This way, you can meet me in person and learn even more about me and my sweet and gentle nature.

Ace,Altdeutscher Hütehund - Mischling,"7 years",Male,"Even at a young age, Ace was a real bully and always rolled up his sleeves, ready for a fight. Now he acts much more carefully and observes situations very closely before firing up the throttle. As is so often the case in social interactions, with Ace, too, ""the tone makes the music"" – respectful interaction is very important to him and the key to a functioning relationship. The harsher the tone, the quicker Ace's comments fall on deaf ears, and he likes to remind the other person who they are and who they are actually talking to.
Everyday life with Ace is often like a shared dance. He now has a fixed choreography. Daily life at the animal shelter is precisely timed and gives Ace a structure to orient himself by. You float through the day together, everyone knows each other's next steps, you tune into one another and don't step on each other's toes in everyday life – but it's also about inspiring one another and helping each other move forward. To ensure that we don't get stuck in the same place amidst all the routine, we're constantly striving to develop and hone our daily performance. Everyone's freedom is also a big issue here. When physically harassed (giving spot-on medication, removing ticks), he often resorts to his tried-and-true way of getting space. You can either make the situation more comfortable for him so he doesn't trigger in the first place, or use it as a training measure to discuss the relationship and their respective statuses. Wearing a muzzle is incredibly important, especially in such moments, and it will remain a constant companion for Ace in the future.
Even when interacting with other dogs, the black shaggy dog tries to present himself, testing his counterpart's boundaries in a more or less subtle way. His fuse has now lengthened a little, and he's learned to let things slide sometimes. If the match is right, being with a fellow dog is a welcome change, especially during his time in the animal shelter. Nevertheless, dog encounters are a classic problem for Ace, too. On the leash, he generally behaves very externally oriented. It is therefore important to make it clear to him that he is not responsible for resolving every situation, but that the human at the other end of the leash takes over this task. Exuding calm and composure in stressful moments is a real challenge, but this basic disposition also helps Ace keep a cool head. Whether in dog encounters specifically or during walks in general, Ace still has a lot to learn. Since he sometimes attacks his owners when jumping up, when frustrated, or to test them, he is muzzled during these activities. By harnessing his eagerness to work, you can redirect him and calmly exit the situation.
With the right people, this black chaotic dog can become a truly good companion. Experience with dogs, stamina, and strong nerves are extremely important for this. Because the risk of a biting incident is too high, Ace should be kept muzzled consistently in his new home. This way, you can challenge, encourage, and grow together without running any major risks.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg
Eddy,Cane Corso-Bulldog Mix,"5 years",Male,"Eddy came to us after being confiscated. He is now in the training center because he would lunge at his animal keepers in stressful situations with his whole body. At 38.9 kg, not everyone can withstand that. However, he is now easy to handle and no longer lunges at other people, even in stressful situations. He shows strangers (both men and women) that he does not want to be bothered by growling and staring. He knows the common basic commands and is easily motivated with food. He is an alert dog who takes good care of his property.
The powerful Eddy will only be rehomed to people with the appropriate expertise and who have the necessary physical requirements to keep such a dog. He is not a city dog and needs a rural environment. There should be no children or other dogs in his new home.

Strangers, however, are chased away, sometimes with the use of her teeth. She wears a muzzle when we visit and trusts us to decide who is allowed in and who isn't. However, she needs clear instructions that she is not in charge. She is social with other dogs she knows and enjoys playing. She knows horses and ignores them. She likes to hunt by sight. For example, when chasing butterflies and birds, she can completely forget the world around her if she isn't stopped. Cully generally accepts leadership and boundaries, but asks for more detailed questions and needs people with dog experience.

A secure first dog would help him immensely in his forever home, but is not required. A garden is also not required.

Yuki,Mischling,"2 years",Male,"Yuki may be a small dog, but he's a big one at heart.
He's always first in line when it comes to petting and food. Otherwise, this young man is brimming with energy and loves to romp around with his fellow dogs. He gets along well with them, even if he can be quite cheeky at times.
His future owners should be prepared for some training, because Yuki knows what he wants and what he doesn't want. In addition to the basic commands, which Yuki still has to learn, there are situations in which he defends resources and would unfortunately use his teeth in the process. We are already training Yuki on this, and his future owners should be willing to continue the training. We will, of course, advise you accordingly.
Yuki walks well on a leash when we go for walks and prefers a more leisurely pace outside. Nevertheless, he also enjoys going for a long walk now and then. Yuki isn't the greatest runner, though. He's also not suited to dog sports.

Rocky is now making great progress, is sweet, and knows all the basic commands. During the initial period, the owner, who worked on all of this with him, is happy to help them to ensure a smooth transition. He gets along well with female dogs, but with male dogs, it's all about sympathy. He's also used to life in a household, although he's still a bit boisterous there.

The first few walks with Mira were more like a tug-of-war, and every other animal in sight was reason enough for another battle of strength, which wasn't due to any ill will, but rather to the fact that her life had certainly been lacking in experiences up to that point.
With a lot of practice, consistency, and routine, the walks became actual walks, and she suddenly revealed a completely different side of herself to ""her"" people. A sensitive, warm-hearted Mira, who certainly adheres to certain rules and can barely contain her joy when visitors she has taken to her heart arrive. A dog who doesn't necessarily want to be the center of attention, but still enjoys being there and, based on mutual respect, can prove to be a great companion with a very close bond.","Zur Staustufe 36, 91301 Forchheim, Deutschland",Tierschutzverein Forchheim

Amy also has a problem with resource aggression; she defends her food. In the animal shelter, she is very sensitive to stress and reacts fearfully, especially in new situations. She is not (yet) always predictable and is sometimes aggressive with us. She is only quite obedient towards her caregiver. Amy has been undergoing behavioral therapy with us for months and has made so much progress that she can now be rehomed. However, she will always be a difficult dog who will only go with very knowledgeable people. With us, she is allowed to run around with a few selected dog friends in a small group during the day, but she always wears a muzzle, which she has associated with positive things. In general, she doesn't like other dogs very much (exceptions prove the rule), which is why she will be kept as an only dog in the future.
For Amy, we are looking for very experienced, confident people who have extensive experience with aggression in dogs and can provide the necessary clear leadership and stable structures – these provide security. Amy is not suitable for the city and is also not suitable for children.

While she's initially a bit insecure around strangers, if you give her space and let her decide for herself when she wants to make contact, the ice quickly breaks, and Nagini reveals her cuddly side.
The Alabai, or Central Asian Shepherd Dog, is a herd protector. These dogs cannot be handled by just anyone; they need dedicated caregivers who guide the dog with confident composure. Physically, herd protectors like Nagini are very strong. They were bred to protect grazing animals from large attackers, such as wolves. This requires courage and decisiveness, which is why herd protectors tend to quickly step forward when they feel threatened.
Due to her breed, Nagini will only be adopted by people with a lot of dog experience (ideally, herd protectors) and a house and garden. Whether she gets along with other dogs depends on how well they interact. Older, sensible children, about 12 years and older, are no problem for her.

After the auto repair shop I was allowed to guard for almost my entire life was sold, I had to go to the animal shelter. I've been sitting here since October 2024 and I don't understand what's going on. Everyday life in the animal shelter is extremely stressful for me. This manifests itself in the fact that I bark incessantly in my kennel because I just want to be with people. Furthermore, all the stress is really upsetting my stomach, so I've lost (too) many pounds. My keepers are very worried about me because they're afraid I'll starve to death from a full bowl. The animal shelter also diagnosed me with hypothyroidism and pancreatitis. Both are well controlled with medication and special food.
I generally get along well with other dogs, but I would still like a home or a foster home as a single prince, as I really enjoy spending a lot of time with my humans. Encounters with dogs on a leash are a big challenge for me, as I used to have to keep intruders away as a guard dog. My regular dog walker is already working hard on this with me.
An overnight trip to my regular dog walker showed that I calm down quite quickly after a bit of excitement indoors. My greatest wish is a comfortable basket with loving people who have plenty of time and perhaps some German Shepherd experience in a quiet, rural area, where I can finally settle in and enjoy my retirement. Children are not a problem either, but ideally they should already be teenagers so that they can grow up to me physically.

H21-049 Fritzi,Mischling,"10 years",Male,"Fritzi – A Broken Soul Seeks Support and a Heart
Fritzi is no easy task – but for the right person, he could be the greatest gift. This impressive mix of Great Dane, Labrador, and Malinois has clearly experienced a lot of bad things in his life so far. His trust in people has been shaken, and he shows this clearly when strangers get too close.
Fritzi reacts very sensitively to anything he perceives as a threat. Harsh, loud voices or careless movements like raising a hand can trigger fear in him. That's why he absolutely needs a home with someone experienced in dogs, someone who understands his language, acts with foresight, and accompanies him safely through life.
Fritzi isn't looking for just anyone – he's looking for the one person who truly sees him. Give him a chance to rewrite his story.","Am Tierheim 1, 15757 Halbe, Deutschland",Tierheim Märkisch Buchholz
Rufus,Schäferhund,"2 years",Male,"Rufus was found in Leer, and unfortunately, no owner could be identified. Rufus is now looking for a new home.
His almost-new owner, however, regularly walks Rufus and is looking for a great family for a great dog.
Rufus's behavior is very typical of a German Shepherd. As long as he is led consistently, firmly, and calmly, he is an uncomplicated and easy-to-handle dog. However, if he feels he has to sort things out on his own, he will display undesirable behavior (e.g., leash aggression).
Rufus reacts to movement stimuli and has difficulty dealing with hectic behavior (e.g., excited other dogs). Our dog trainer is currently working with Rufus on alternative behavior, and he is very willing to learn.","Augustfehner Straße 8, 26670 Uplengen, Germany",Tierheim Jübberde

He would prefer a house with a property where he can romp around. Shadow is relatively compatible with other dogs. On walks, Shadow is not a problem with other dogs, but we see him as an only dog in his new home. Shadow needs people who can give him clear rules and set boundaries; otherwise, he likes to resolve situations on his own and can be very protective. We would like Shadow to live in a quiet household without children.","Ausbau 2a, 39288 Burg (bei Magdeburg), Deutschland",Tierheim Burg/Schartau

In stressful situations, Goliath becomes insecure, but is easily motivated with treats and enjoys learning new things. If he does steal a blanket or something similar, you can negotiate a trade with him for sausages, so he'll give it back. Classic ball games aren't really his thing. A long walk with a dip in the lake is more appealing to this water lover.
Goliath currently lives with other dogs, which is why a home with a confident, relaxed female dog is also an option for him. We are looking for people with experience with dogs who are both empathetic and have the necessary consistency to provide structure for this little rascal. Children should not live in the household.

He already has a near-perfect grasp of the basics of dog training. Due to his insecurity around people, he wears a muzzle on walks, but he is already very accustomed to it.

Hallo ihr Lieben, ich bin Bandina, ein junges Hundemädchen mit weichem, dreifarbigem Fell und großen Kulleraugen, die direkt in die Herzen schauen. Laut Tierarzt wurde ich im Mai 2025 geboren. Mit meinen etwa 35 cm bin ich noch klein, werde aber später zu einer mittelgroßen Hündin (ca. 40–48 cm) heranwachsen. Ich bin ein sanftes, freundliches Wesen und brauche Menschen, die mir Zeit geben, in Ruhe anzukommen. Die Welt ist für mich noch neu. Fremde Situationen, laute Geräusche oder schnelle Bewegungen können mich verunsichern. Menschen finde ich grundsätzlich toll und ich fasse relativ schnell Vertrauen, doch plötzliche Bewegungen oder Berührungen von oben machen mir noch ein bisschen Angst. Mit Geduld, Liebe und einem ruhigen Umfeld werde ich aber sicher schnell lernen, dass ich nichts zu befürchten habe. Mit anderen Hunden verstehe ich mich gut, allerdings neige ich dazu, meine Bezugsperson sehr für mich zu beanspruchen. Deshalb wäre es schön, wenn keine weiteren Hunde im eigenen Haushalt leben. Spaziergänge oder Treffen mit Artgenossen sind aber völlig in Ordnung. Katzen sind kein Problem für mich, mit ihnen komme ich gut zurecht. Kinder sind ebenfalls in Ordnung, solange sie ruhig, rücksichtsvoll und nicht zu hektisch sind, denn meine sensible Art möchte respektiert werden. Das Hunde 1×1 lerne ich gerade noch, aber ich gebe mir Mühe und lerne am liebsten in meinem eigenen Tempo. Ich wünsche mir ein Zuhause, in dem ich Vertrauen aufbauen darf bei Menschen, die mich nicht drängen, sondern mir zeigen, wie schön und sicher die Welt sein kann. Wenn du das Gefühl hast, dass wir zusammenpassen könnten, dann melde dich gern bei mir.
Vermittelt werde ich mit einem Schutzvertrag und gegen eine Schutzgebühr von 550,- EUR. Ich bin selbstverständlich geimpft, gechipt und entwurmt und bereits bei Tasso registriert. Du kannst bei uns im Verein für mich ein passendes Sicherheitsgeschirr, normales Geschirr, Halsband und Leine neuwertig erwerben. Dieses Starterpaket sorgt dafür, dass ich mich von Anfang an sicher, geborgen und gut versorgt fühle.

Hello dear people, my name is Joy, and I'm a little girl with a big, loving heart. My estimated due date, according to the vet, is July 2025. I'm currently about 29 cm tall, but one day I'll grow into a wonderful medium-sized dog of about 40-50 cm. My journey here hasn't been easy, as I come from a kill shelter – a place where fear and hopelessness are palpable every day. But I was rescued, and for that I am incredibly grateful and ready to start a new life. My soft, black and white fur is perfect for petting, but the most precious thing about me is my gentle, quiet nature. I'm still shy and sometimes fearful, because I had to endure so much before I was even allowed to be a puppy. But I want to learn, to trust, to become brave – step by step, by your side. Every gentle touch, every kind word, and every little moment of security means so much to me. If you show me how beautiful life can be and teach me the basics of being a dog, I promise you that I will grow with love, trust, and devotion. I get along well with other dogs and cats, and despite my insecurity, I greet people with cautious openness and a gentle wag of my tail full of hope. Children are welcome in my new home, as long as they treat my delicate heart gently and lovingly. My greatest wish is for a home where I can truly arrive—a place where I am loved, find comfort when I am scared, and explore the world with you. I long for warmth, security, closeness, and people who accept me just as I am. Perhaps you are the very people who will finally give my little heart a home. I'm waiting for you with great hope.
I'm being rehomed through the animal welfare organization SOS Vergessene Pfoten Tierschutz e.V. with a protection contract and for a protection fee of €550.

Rakete (Walther´s Biggi),Patterdale Terrier,"1 year",Female,"Achtung; Achtung – hier kommt Rakete! Als ungebändigte, junge Terrierhündin trat Rakete plötzlich und mit voller Wucht in das zuvor so ruhige Leben ihrer Vorbesitzerin. Der gute Wille und die Hilfsbereitschaft, die sie anfangs überzeugte, die junge Hündin bei sich aufzunehmen, reichten schlussendlich leider nicht aus, um Rakete das zu bieten, was sie wirklich braucht.
Wer die Vorurteile gegenüber Terriern kennt wird in der Patterdale Hündin ein gefundenes Fressen finden - denn ja, das Kopfkino beim Stichwort „Terrier“ erfüllt sie in vielen Punkten mit Gusto. „Vorwärts immer – rückwärts nimmer“ nahm sich das schwarze Duracellhäschen besonders zu Herzen und wurde unter anderem durch kopfloses Bällchen werfen weiterhin in ihrer Rastlosigkeit und Hektik bestärkt. An Pausenzeiten und Ruhe war in der Vergangenheit nicht zu denken und so nutzen wir die Eingewöhnungszeit und damit verbundenen „Startschwierigkeiten“, um dem Gaspedal eine kleine Pause zu gönnen.
Der Umzug ins Tierheim und die klare Führung brachten einen kleinen Reset mit sich. Besonders in den ersten Tagen und Wochen fiel es ihr schwer Fuß zu fassen und sich einzuleben, denn hinter der harten Schale steckt eigentlich ein recht weicher, sanfter Kern. Besonders in ihrer gewohnten Umgebung zeigt sich Rakete als wahre Kuschelmaus und funktioniert den Schoss ihrer Menschen schnell zum Körbchen um. Auch in neuen Situationen sucht sie inzwischen Rückhalt bei ihren Menschen und findet diesen auch schnell in Berührungen, was man sich im Training zu Nutze machen kann. Stichwort Stimmungsübertragung lässt sich Rakete so relativ schnell von der äußeren Aufregung aber auch von ausgestrahlter Ruhe anstecken – Körperkontakt hilft ihr zusätzlich dabei, sich selbst regulieren zu können.
In gewohnten Situationen und besonders reizarmer Umgebung reichen bereits ein sanfter Impuls und Ansprache aus, um die feinfühlige Dame ansprechbar und in der Spur zu halten. Natürlich gibt es auch immer wieder laute, aufregende Momente, in denen es noch schwerer wird, in Kommunikation zu bleiben, doch mit weiterem Training wird es auch hier immer besser. Terrier bleibt auch nach viel Arbeit eben Terrier – und die Stimme ihr Weg, um Stress abzulassen.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg

Now Romy longs for her forever family, someone who will show her the world, give her security, and start a new chapter of her life with her. This young dog is spayed and is likely a Labrador mix. She was born around January 2022, is about 50 centimeters tall, and weighs approximately 16 kilograms. She is happy as an only dog but would also enjoy a confident second dog by her side. Children from about ten years old are suitable for her, and her future home should ideally not be in the middle of the city.

My fluffy, tricolored coat makes me a real cuddle buddy – but what makes me special is my loving and gentle nature. I love exploring the world, playing, and learning new things. Sometimes I'm still a little reserved when everything seems unfamiliar – but with patience and love, I quickly open my heart.

I'm open and friendly with people – once I've gained your trust, I show you my joy and warmth. I love learning and am delighted by every compliment, every pat, and every little reward. My biggest dream is a home where I find comfort, love, and security, where I can cuddle, experience adventures, and simply feel at home. If you show me how beautiful the world can be, I will grow by your side with joy, trust, and confidence. Perhaps you are the very people who will touch my heart and give me my forever home. I am being rehomed through the animal welfare organization SOS Vergessene Pfoten Tierschutz e.V. (SOS Forgotten Paws Animal Welfare) with a protection contract and for a protection fee of €550. I am, of course, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and already registered with Tasso. You can purchase a suitable, like-new safety harness and leash for me from our organization. This starter kit ensures that I feel safe, secure, and well cared for right from the start.

Levi,Mischling,"1 year",Male,"SOS Forgotten Paws,
My name is Levi, I was born in November 2024 and am 36 cm tall when fully grown. I am a friendly, young male dog full of curiosity and joie de vivre, ready to discover the world and experience the love of a family. My cuddly black fur and my big brown eyes make me a real heart-opener – but the best thing about me is my loving and gentle nature. I love being close to people, playing, and exploring the world at my own pace. I get along well with other dogs, and cats are no problem for me either. If there are children in my new home, they should be older and treat me with love and respect – then we will definitely become the very best of friends. I still have to learn the basics of being a doggy, but I am curious, clever, and motivated, so we will surely make great progress together soon. I am ready to give my heart and become your loyal companion for life. Perhaps you are the very people who will capture my heart and give me a loving home.

Romy,Mischling ,"6 years",Female,"SOS Forgotten Paws
Hello, I'm Romy, a gentle, loving, and wonderful dog with an exceptionally beautiful personality and a gorgeous brown coat that shines in the sun. According to the vet, I was born in October 2019, so I've been exploring this big, exciting world for a while now. At 49 cm, I'm already fully grown and the perfect size to accompany you everywhere. My life hasn't always been easy, as I come from a kill shelter, but I've been given a chance and am now spayed and ready for a new beginning. I'm a little explorer at heart: curious, outgoing, and full of joy for new adventures. Life with me is never boring, because I love to run, play, and explore the world with all its exciting smells and sounds. And when the day has tired me out, I enjoy quiet moments just as much, snuggling up to my humans and soaking up the closeness and security. Sometimes I'm a little cheeky, but always in a loving way, because deep down I'm loyal, sensitive, and full of warmth. I long for a family where I can truly belong. If you give me your heart, you'll receive my love a hundredfold. I get along very well with other dogs, and cats shouldn't be a problem in my new home either. Children are welcome, as long as they know how to treat a dog respectfully and gently. I still have some learning to do, but I'm motivated, eager to learn, and looking forward to growing together with you—perhaps even at dog training school—so we can become a real team. If you give me a forever home, I promise you I'll be a loyal companion on every adventure and in every quiet moment, in joy and in peace. Together we can experience the most beautiful moments and share a life full of love. I am being rehomed through the animal welfare organization SOS Vergessene Pfoten Tierschutz e.V.

Haribo,Schäferhund,"6 months",Male,"German Shepherd Haribo, at a young age, already has to make up for the lack of impulse control caused by his previous owners. The young dog was spontaneously purchased in Romania as a future companion for the family's children. Now, however, the little guy isn't so little anymore, and the family's interest in this time-consuming canine hasn't kept pace.
In the meantime, the adorable Haribo has grown into a considerable giant who, unfortunately, hasn't been able to gain much maturity or calmness in recent weeks. As a result of his genetic predisposition and the lack of training, he is now a very restless, easily excitable dog who can hardly settle down and catch his breath. Typical of German Shepherds, he is still eager to learn, and the first signs of progress aren't long in coming, but the list of homework assignments from dog training school is still long.
Being left alone and tolerating frustration are particularly difficult for Haribo. Judging by his thick fur and his behavior so far in his foster home, he likely spent most of his time outside a home environment, kept outdoors in a kennel. The fact that muddy paws don't belong on the tabletop and that there are different surfaces besides grass and stone is completely foreign to him. Even though Haribo still lacks a certain amount of basic training, it's immediately obvious that life in a home is completely new territory for him, and he's not using it as an opportunity to test his boundaries. This makes it all the more important to quickly find a suitable home so that more intensive training can begin. Haribo is only 6 months old and is still growing, both mentally and physically. Especially with dogs of this size, meticulous work is essential to ensure he becomes a manageable and controllable dog in the future. Only then can he become a reliable companion for his humans, without being overly stressed or agitated by external influences.","Wailandtstraße 15, 63741 Aschaffenburg, Deutschland",Tierheim Aschaffenburg
Jana,Mischling ,"8 months",Female,"SOS Forgotten Paws
Hello, dear humans, my name is Jana, and according to the vet, I was born in April 2025. At 31 cm tall, I'm a small, young female dog, and later I'll be a medium-sized beauty, around 40-42 cm tall. My glossy black coat, my brown button eyes, my gentle nature, and my adorable face make me a little heartbreaker. People often call me ""sweetheart,"" and honestly, I gladly accept that compliment. I'm friendly, open, and ready to explore the big wide world with you. I get along well with other dogs, and cats are perfectly fine with me too. Of course, I still have to learn the basics of being a dog—after all, I'm still young—but with a little patience and lots of love, I'm sure I'll settle in quickly and learn everything a family dog needs to know. If there are children in your home, I hope they will treat me with love, consideration, and gentleness. Then we will surely have lots of fun together. If you would like to give me a loving home, please feel free to call. I am already looking forward to giving my heart to my new family. I am being rehomed through the animal welfare organization SOS Vergessene Pfoten Tierschutz e.V. (SOS Forgotten Paws Animal Welfare) with a protection contract and for a protection fee of €550.

Lassie,Mischling,"5 months",Female,"SOS Forgotten Paws Animal Welfare Association
Hello dear dog lovers, my name is Lassie and according to the vet, I was born in July 2025. At my current 30 cm, I'm still a small puppy, but I'll grow into a handsome dog – about 50–70 cm tall. As I'm a livestock guardian dog mix, I'm looking for people with experience, patience, and an understanding of the special characteristics of my breed. I'm in the middle of my growth phase, which makes me very playful, curious, and full of energy. My training should therefore be consistent, loving, and structured. Livestock guardian dogs are known for being watchful, independent, and protective – this makes us wonderful family dogs if you set clear rules and guide us confidently from the start. With good guidance, a suitable dog training school, plenty of exercise, and lots of love, I can develop into a loyal, confident, and well-balanced companion. I want to learn, understand, and grow together with my people – I always give my best for this. In everyday life, I am loyal, affectionate, and incredibly loving. I greatly enjoy closeness and attention and want to be part of a safe, harmonious home. I get along well with other dogs as well as with confident, dog-experienced children who know how to treat me respectfully. Since livestock guardian dogs like to keep an eye on their territory later on, a house of my own with an escape-proof, sturdy fence would be ideal for me. There, I can settle in, develop, and learn at my own pace what it means to be a beloved family member. I look forward to discovering the world with you – with patience, love, and clear guidance, I will become a wonderful companion who will faithfully stand by your side. I am being rehomed through the animal welfare organization SOS Vergessene Pfoten Tierschutz e.V. with an adoption contract and for a rehoming fee of €550. I am of course vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and already registered with Tasso. You can purchase a suitable, like-new safety harness and leash for me from our association. This starter kit will ensure that I feel safe, secure, and well cared for from the very beginning. If you have a heart for gentle souls like me, I would be incredibly happy to meet you.

Zuri doesn't get along well with the resident female dog in her current home, and only there. She displays a protective instinct, which isn't unusual for this breed mix. With good management, this could probably be managed. Zuri hasn't been in Germany long but has already learned a lot. Walks with Zuri are pleasant, and she remains calm and relaxed even when encountering other dogs. She gets along well with female dogs. We are looking for people familiar with this breed for this spayed female. With the right guidance, she could certainly live with a friendly male dog.
